## Overview
In this Project,On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc we are predicting Price range of the mobile

## Motivation
After Learning all the concepts it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.This is aim of this project

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository.
