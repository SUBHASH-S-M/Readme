## Overview
In this Project,we are doing Corona Virus Live Tracking For India
## Dataset
You can just read the data set as json format from this [link](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/data/datanew.json)

## Motivation
After Learning all the concepts it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.This is aim of this project

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7 If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository.
